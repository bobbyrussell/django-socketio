# CHANGELOG
Django SocketIO
##0.1.0 (03.19.2015)
###Initial Release
This project is meant to be a simple implementation of a chat client and server
running on Django 1.7 and Socket.IO 1.3. My focus will be on clarity of code,
and in simplicity of implementation and maintenance.

I'll be adding features as I go. The plan is to add Redis, some kind of
persistence, and all the utilities necessary to deploy the app into production.
